This section provides an in-depth look into the **AWS-based projects** I’ve worked on, showcasing various cloud services, deployment models, and automation techniques. Each project is designed to solve real-world challenges and enhance security, scalability, and efficiency in cloud environments.  

### 🔹 **Project 1: Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an IAM User in AWS**  

📌 **Description**: This project serves as a **detailed guide on setting up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Users**. IAM is a critical AWS service that enables administrators to manage **secure access to AWS resources**, ensuring that users have the appropriate level of permissions based on their roles. The guide covers **user creation, permissions management, and security best practices**.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Creating **IAM users** with custom permissions.  
- Assigning users to **IAM groups** for streamlined access control.  
- Configuring **IAM policies** to enforce **least privilege access**.  
- Enabling **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for additional security.  
- Understanding IAM **roles, access keys, and security best practices**.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:**  
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** – Secure user and permissions management.  
- **AWS Management Console** – GUI for configuring IAM users and policies.  
- **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)** – Automating IAM user creation and management.  

This project is perfect for **AWS beginners, cloud engineers, and security administrators** who want to **learn best practices for securing AWS accounts** while ensuring **proper access control and user management**. 🚀

### 🔹 **Project 2: Mounting Amazon EFS on an EC2 Instance in AWS: A Step-by-Step Guide**  

📌 **Description**: This project provides a **detailed step-by-step guide** on how to mount **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** on an **Amazon EC2 instance**. EFS is a **scalable, fully managed shared file storage** service designed for use with AWS cloud resources. This guide covers **creating an EFS file system, configuring security groups, connecting an EC2 instance, and mounting EFS for persistent storage.**  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Setting up an **Amazon EFS** file system for shared storage.  
- Configuring **EC2 Security Groups** to allow NFS traffic.  
- Connecting to an **EC2 instance** using EC2 Instance Connect.  
- Installing necessary **EFS utilities** and mounting the file system.  
- Managing **permissions, file operations, and storage scalability**.  

🛠 **Technologies Used:**  
- **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** – Managed NFS storage service.  
- **Amazon EC2** – Virtual server to mount and access EFS.  
- **AWS Security Groups** – Controls network access for EFS and EC2.  
- **Linux CLI (Bash)** – Command-line interface for setup and configuration.  
- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** – Provides network connectivity between EC2 and EFS.  

This project is ideal for **AWS beginners** and **cloud engineers** looking to learn how to implement **persistent, scalable, and shared file storage** for cloud-based applications. 🚀
